Lossy image codec using discrete wavelet transform.

It supports/implements:
- Deslauriers-Dubuc 13/7 and CDF 5/3, wavelets.
- Configurable quality loss ([examples](#examples) below).
- 8 bits per component. 4 channels.
- Reversible YCoCg color transformation.
- Elias coding + Rle compression. Nonetheless the codec can handle ratios of 1:12 before artifacts became visible.
- Good performance. There is care on cache and memory usage.
- Everything is done with integers. This ensure always identical outputs (even in lossy compression) and provides gain in performance.

And in a more experimental state:
- Lossless compression.


Compilation
-----------
Aside from C and C++ compilers (later only needed to build executable tools), the only requirement is [cmake][1]. On Ubuntu you can install them with:

```
sudo apt install cmake
```

Then compile with:
```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build . --config Release
```


Usage
-----
Two executables: `akoenc` and `akodec` will let you try the codec. Run them whitout any argument to read the usage help. But, in most cases is:

```
akoenc -q 16 -i "input.png" -o "out.ako"
```
- Where `-q 16` is the quantization step that controls loss.
- There is also a noise gate, with `-g 16`, it can be used as a denoiser to help with compression. It is possible to use both, or disable either one with a value of zero.


Examples
--------
Following examples are mere illustrations. Chosen compression ratios are too high to be useful in real life.

Note how fine details are discarded while sharp lines and overall shapes remain intact, this whitout visible blocks. And all modern codecs do this, however here it is remarkable since Ako lacks of quality estimation or rate-distortion optimizations (tasks to improve the codec further).
