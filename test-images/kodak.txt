                       About the Kodak Photo CD
                            Photo Sampler

The Images

This compact disc is a sample KODAK Photo CD containing 24 photographic
quality images of a variety of subjects in many locations, and under a
variety of lighting conditions.  Thumbnail size replicas of these images
are printed on the cover of the Photo CD case.  Some of the images were
created by Kodak's professional photographers; others were selected from
the winners of the Kodak International Newspaper Snapshot Awards (KINSA),
an annual amateur photo competition sponsored by Kodak and participating
newspapers in several countries.  As with any image, your possession of
a physical copy of these digitized images does not in itself mean you
have unlimited rights to use the images.  Most images, including those
on this disc, are protected by copyright, and use requires the permission
of the copyright owner.  For the images on this sampler disc, Kodak 
grants the following rights:

  Authorized holders of the Photo CD sampler disc may use, manipulate,
  store, transmit, reproduce and display the recorded images for any
  purpose associated with electronic imaging.  Unless otherwise agreed,
  a picture credit identifying the photographer must accompany each
  reproduction of an image, but no picture credits may be used for
  images altered or manipulated other than by cropping, enlarging,
  "dodging and burning" or changing overall color balance.

The Format

Images on the Photo CD are encoded in five uniquely formatted resolu-
tions.  Users can select the resolution on the basis of intended use:

  o  Thumbnail, for selecting and previewing (Base/16, 128x192 pixels)
  o  Snapshot, for low-resolution image manipulation (Base/4, 256x384
     pixels)
  o  TV-comparable, for moderate resolution (Base, 512x768 pixels)
  o  HDTV, for high-resolution image handling (Base X4, 1024x1536 pixels)
  o  Full detail, for photographic-quality printing and enlargement
     (Base X16, 2048x3072 pixels)

The Access

You can view these images on a KODAK Photo CD Player or a Philips CD-I
player connected to any standard home television set.

Alternatively, if you have a computer with a Photo CD compatible CD ROM
drive (Mode 2 and Form 1), you can also display these images using KODAK
Photo CD Access software.  This software converts the images to popular
file formats and exports to most image enabled software products.

Application software that has been developed using the Kodak Photo CD
Access software is capable of accessing the Photo CD images from within
their menus for more convenient use of the images.  Look for the Photo
CD logo on packaging to indicate this capability.

To achieve the full impact and quality of these images you should use a
full color 24-bit display system on your computer.
